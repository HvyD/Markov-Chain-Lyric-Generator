Forever trust in who we are
No, nothing else matters
Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite, yeah
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land
Yeah heah

In your closet, in your head

New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pain disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on
He's known
Oooh a vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven
They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

Never shined through in what I've shown

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further, every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
I cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness, taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me
Can save myself
But it's too late
Now I can't think
Think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though
It never existed
Death greets me warm
Now I will just say goodbye
Bye...
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there is not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me
Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell
End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear
Sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream

Master

Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master
Master
You promised only lies
Laughter
Laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter
Laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
(Solo #2)
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you, too
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master

Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream

As I was goin' over
The Cook and Kerry mountains
I saw the Captain Farrell
His money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol
And then produced my rapier
I said, "stand and deliver"
Or the devil he may take ya
I took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money
And I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she'd love me
No never would she leave me
But devil take that woman!
Yeah!
For you know, she tricked me easy
Mush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Being drunk and weary
I went to Molly's chamber
Taking Molly with me
But I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven
Yeah, I watched Captain Farrell
I jumped up, with my pistols
And I shot him with both barrells
Mush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah, yeah, whiskey!
Yeah, oh
Now some men like the fishing
And some men like the fowling
And some men like the hear
The hear cannon ball a roaring
Me, I like sleeping
Specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison
Here I am with a ball and chain, yeah
Mush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah!
Whiskey in the jar-o
Mush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Mush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Mush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Mush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Lay beside me
Tell me what they've done
Speak the words I wanna hear
To make my demons run
The door is locked now
But it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me
Then I can understand the you
Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night
We share this paralyze
The door cracks open
But there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still
But there's no sun shining through
No there's no sun shining through
No there's no sun shining
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?
Come lay beside me
This won't hurt I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still
But she'll never love again
She lay beside me
But she'll be there when I'm gone
Black hearts scarring darker still
Yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?
Lay beside me
Tell me what I've done
The door is closed so are your eyes
But now I see the sun
Now I see the sun
Yes now I see it
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for you
Oh, what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Oh, what I've felt
Oh, what I've known
I'll take this key and I'll bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven too
Never free, never me
'Cause you're unforgiven too
On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines
moanin' Out its one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through
Here I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
There I go, Playin' star again
There I go, Turn The Page
So you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode
Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
But other times you can
All the same old clichÃ©s:
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your stand
Here I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
Here I go, Playn' star again
There I go, Turn The Page
Whoa-oh
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try and give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Rememberin' what she said
What she said
(Yeah, what she said.)
Yeah
Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playn' star again
There I go, Turn The Page
And there I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah
There I go, there I go
(And I'm gone)

Sad but true
How could he know this new dawn's light, would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course, by the light of golden treasure
Was he the one, causing pain, With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid, Of the things he's feeling
He
could
just
be
gone
He
would just
sail on
He'll just sail on
How can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive.
And how can I blame you, When it's me I can't forgive?
These days drift on inside a fog, It's thick and suffocating
His seeking life outside its hell, Inside intoxicating
He's run aground
Like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast
Down with his ship
Fading in the shadows
Now
...a...
castaway
They've
all gone
away
They've gone away
How can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you?, When it's me I can't forgive?
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course, By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light, Would change his life forever?
How can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you, When it's me I can't forgive?
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
The dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Can I breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, (just leave me alone)
Fear of living on, natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air, got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard, kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way for reaching out again
Born to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground
Mouths so full of lies
Tend to block your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes
Push you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time
God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes
Love is a four-letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four-letter word
Here in this prison
I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear
The sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This, I swear
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men on five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls
And the road becomes my bride
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride, so in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied, gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save, to the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home
And the earth becomes my throne
And the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown, under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone, I ask no one
And my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain, off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my time anywhere
Anywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lie but still I roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy

Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped

Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say

And it feels right this time
On his crash course with the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
New day fills his head with wonder, boy
Says it feels right this time
Turned it 'round and found the right line
Good day to be alive, Sir
Good day to be alive he says.
Then it comes to be

Mama she has taught me well
Told me when i was young
"son your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done"
"the brightest flame burns quickest"
That's what i heard her say
A son's heart sowed to mother
But i must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Yeah still
Rebel mind your last name
Wild blood in my veins
They bring strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what i heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Mama, now i'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Spoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
Not a thing you said to me
I needed your arms to welcome me
But, a cold stone's all i see
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Let this heart be still
Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution's end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blackened
Opposition... contradiction... premonition... compromise
Agitation... violation... mutilation... planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination... expiration... cancellation... human race
Expectation... liberation... population... lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Fire
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackened
Blackened
On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines
moanin' Out its one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through
Here I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
There I go, Playin' star again
There I go, Turn The Page
So you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode
Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
But other times you can
All the same old clichÃ©s:
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your stand
Here I am, On the road again
There I am, Up on the stage
Here I go, Playn' star again
There I go, Turn The Page
Whoa-oh
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try and give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Rememberin' what she said
What she said
(Yeah, what she said.)
Yeah
Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playn' star again
There I go, Turn The Page
And there I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah
There I go, there I go
(And I'm gone)
Late at night, all systems go
You've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest
You make it real, you know
There's a feeling, deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling, of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It's hot as hell tonight
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, Kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill
Cause this is what we choose
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Here we go!
(1st solo)
Whiplash!
(2nd solo)
The show is through, the metal's gone
It's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
We'll never stop, we'll never quit
Cause we're Metallica
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Ow, ow!
So fucking what!
Well, I've been to Hastings and I've been to Brighton
I've been to Eastbourne too.
So what, so what.
And I've been here, I've been there
I've been every fucking where.
So what, so what.
So what, so what, you boring little cunt.
Well, who cares, who cares what you do.
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you.
Well, I fucked a queen, I fucked fuck
I've even sucked an old man's cock.
So what, so what.
And I fucked a sheep, I fucked a goat
I rammed my cock right down its throat.
So what, so what.
So what, so what, you boring little fuck.
Well, who cares, who cares what you do.
And, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you.
And I've drunk that, I've drunk this
I've spewed up on a pint of piss.
So what, so what.
I've had scank, I've had speed
I've jacked up until I bleed.
So what, so what.
So what, so what, you boring little cunt.
Well, who cares, who cares what you do.
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you, you.
solo
I've had crabs, I've had lice
I've had the clap and that ain't nice.
So what, so what.
I fucked this, I fucked that
I've even fucked a school girl's twat.
So what, so what.
So what, so what, you boring little fuck.
Well, who cares, who cares what you do.
And, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you, you.
So fucking what! Yeah!
Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life is for my own to live my own way
The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?
Still the window burns, time so slowly turns
Someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?
(Mama, they try and break me)
(Still they try and break me)
'scuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking stops by wheels of despair
Don't want your aid
But the fist I've made for years won't hold or feel
No I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel
But now the dreams and waking screams that ever last through the night
So build the wall behind it crawl and hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?
Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames, can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?
But now the dreams and waking screams that
ever last the night
So build a wall behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, they try
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, the try
By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knocks at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
You have been dying since the day
You were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation
Gone insane
We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
GO!
On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to great destroyer
Doom design
We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
OH!
Once upon a planet burning
Once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning
All in vain
Do you feel that hope is fading?
Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating?
In the end
We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Hardwired to self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct
Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we? re the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it but it' s no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage incorporated
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage incorporated
Go
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All' s fair for damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage incorporated
Wish I may
Wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold
Dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?
All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased
And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing, just to play the King
But the castle crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?
Hard and cold
Bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Yeah! Are you satisfied?
Wish I might, Wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?
All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing. just to play the King
But the castle crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?
Huh!
Wish I may, wish I might
Have this wish, I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how
Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish you may regret it
Careful what you wish you just might get it
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing, just to play the King
But the castle crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Nothing
Oh, You're just nothing
Where's your crown King Nothing?
Oh, you're just nothing
Absolutely nothing
Off to never never land
Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run but it stays right by my side
So tear me open, pour me out!
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps
Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feel it once and now it stays
Now it stays
So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean
It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you so hold me
Until it sleeps
So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed
Don't want it
I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps
It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you until it sleeps
I don't want it
So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me
Till clean
I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps

Don't tread on me
So don't tread on me
Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged...
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage
So don't tread on me
So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...
Don't tread on me
Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as a lightning strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance
Woo, no, no, no...
So don't tread on me
So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...
Don't tread on me
So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling on her tail
So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...
Don't tread on me

My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, Oh the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.
Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.
Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.
Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah.
Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination
Keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward
Seems to me absurd
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside
To each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen
I see through the selfish lie
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
(Bridge and solo)
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence
Lengthen freedom's ring
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up, shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies
Infanticide
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow

Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do that fistful will
Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction
Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction
So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again
Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Addicted to the
Fame

Fortune, fame, mirror vain, gone insane
But the memory remains
Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd cry the nowhere tears of honor
Like twisted vines that grow
That hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light of an already faded prima donna
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
But the memory remains
Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back
And can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
Dance little tin goddess
(na-na-na-na...)
Drift away, fade away, little tin goddess
Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
But the memory remains
Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black
But the memory remains
Yeah
Faded prima donna, yeah, yeah
Dance little tin goddess, dance

Been here before, been here before
Been here before, been here before
Been here before couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be un crazy?
Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'
It comes alive, it comes alive
It comes alive and I die a little more
It comes alive, it comes alive
It comes alive each moment here I die a little more

Takes me away
Been here before, been here before
Been here before, been here before
Been here before, been here before
I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I cannot stand it anymore
I cross my heart and hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon
It comes alive, it comes alive
It comes alive and I die a little more
It comes alive, it comes alive
It comes alive each moment here I die a little more
Ooh, I die, I die, I die a little more

You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
Rise, fall down, rise again
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
Rise, fall down, rise again
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
Through black days, through black nights
Through pitch black insights
Breaking your teeth on the hard life a-coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard!
The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
Dawn, death, fight, final breath
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
Dawn, death, fight, final breath
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
They scratch me, they scrape me
They cut and rape me
Breaking your teeth on the hard life a-coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard!
Breaking your teeth on the hard life a-coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Braiding your soul in a hard luck story
Show your scars
Spilling your blood in a hot sun's foray
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
We die hard!
We die hard!
We die hard!
Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eyes' disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Wreckening
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Pulled for you
Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
It's teeth and talons through
You're living catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you

Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You're reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must suit you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You, you're smothered in tragedy
And you're off to save the world
Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery
You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You, you'll take it on all yourself
Remember, misery loves company
Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery, my friend of misery
You just stood there screaming
My friend of misery
Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery, my friend of misery
You just stood there screaming
My friend of misery
Yeah, yeah, go
Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through
the land
Come home where you belong
So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire
Late at night all systems go
You have come to see the show
We do our best you're the rest
You make it real you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It is hot as hell tonight
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Here on the stage the marshal noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass kick your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now is the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We are gathered here to I'm and kill
'Cause this is what we choose
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
The show is through the metal is gone
It is time to hit the road
Another town another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we will never stop
We will never quit
'Cause we are Metallica
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
(instrumental)
Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say?
I'll take your life from you
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
(SOLO)
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They are trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
Im through with this
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by a horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames
Look hard at the darkness
And you will see
Just call my name and I'll be there
You cannot touch me
You would not dare
I am the chill that's in the air
And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day
Dark rivers are flowing
Back into the past
You are the fish for which I cast
And what of the future
What is to be
As the rivers flow into the sea
And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day
Do not take for granted
Powers out there
Don't step into the demon's lair
Time is an illusion,
Rising from time,
Steep is the mountain which we climb.
And I try to get through to you,
In my own special way,
As the barriers crumble,
At the end of the day
And now I wait my whole lifetime
For you
And now I wait my whole lifetime
For you
I ride the dirt, I ride the tide
For you
I search the outside, search inside
For you
To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime
I'm outlaw torn
I'm outlaw torn
And I'm torn
So on I wait my whole lifetime
For you
So on I wait my whole lifetime
For you
The more I search the more my need
For you
The more I bless the more I bleed
For you
You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime
Outlaw torn
I'm outlaw torn
Yeah, I'm outlaw torn
And I'm torn

Seize that crown, yeah, 'cause I am what I am
What I am, what I am, plus I am
I'm your loverman
There's a devil laying by your side
(How much longer?)
There's a devil laying by your side
(How much longer?)
You might think he's asleep but take a look at his eyes
(How much longer?)
And he wants you, darling, to be his bride
(How much longer?)
Yeah, there's a devil laying by your side
(How much longer?)
Loverman, loverman, loverman
I'll be your loverman till the end of the time
Till the empires burn down forever, amen
I'll be your loverman, I'll be your loverman
I'm your loverman, I'm your loverman
Yeah, I'm your loverman, I'm your loverman
Loverman, I'm your loverman
I'm your loverman, I'm your loverman
Yeah, I'm your loverman, yes, I'm your loverman
Loverman, loverman, loverman forever, amen
Loverman
(How much longer?)
When darkness falls, may it be
That we should see the light
When reaper calls, may it be
That we walk straight and right
When doubt returns, may it be
That faith shall permeate our scars
When we're seduced, then may it be
That we not deviate our cause
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever
When all is pain, may it be
It's all we've ever known
When flame consumes, may it be
It warms our dying bones
When loss has won, may it be
It's you I'm madly fighting for
When kingdom comes, may it be
We walk right through that open door
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever
Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live forever
All that is, was and will be
Universe much too big to see
Time and space never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitations of human understanding
Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive
All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never
In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest, meaning, reason
Came to be, how it begun
All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun
All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never
On through the never
We must go
On through the never
Out of the
Edge of forever
We must go
On through the never
Then ever comes
All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever
Who we are
Ask forever
Twisting
Turning
Through the never
Never
Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above
It feeds (it feeds)
It grows (it grows)
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow The God That Failed
Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road on your way
Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave
It feeds (it feeds)
It grows (it grows)
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow The God That Failed

I see faith in your eyes
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow The God That Failed
Pride you took

Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Trust you gave
A child to save

I see faith in your eyes
Never your hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow The God That Failed
Follow The God That Failed
Broken is the promise
Betrayal, betrayal
Messenger of Fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for Father, roaming free
Fearless Wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the Shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness
You dwell
Crawling Chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Fearless Wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Hunter of the Shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness
You dwell
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons Death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face "The Thing That Should Not Be"
Fearless Wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the Shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness
You dwell
Come unto me and you will feel perfection
Come unto me and dedicate
Come unto me, you'll never feel rejection
Come unto me and terminate
Remove your heart, it's only good for bleeding
Bleeding through your fragile skin
Remove your thought, 'cause it's only for deceiving
Deceiving thoughts destroy within
Disappear like man was never here
Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone
Plug into me, I guarantee devotion
Plug into me and dedicate
Plug into me and I'll save you from emotion
Plug into me and terminate
Accelerate, Utopian solution
Finally cure the Earth of man
Exterminate, speeding up the evolution
Set on course a master plan
Reinvent the earth inhabitant
Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone
The flesh betrays the flesh
Your man has had his time
We lay him down to rest
Machined the new divine
Stop breathing
And dedicate to me
Stop dreaming
And terminate for me
All meaning
You dedicate to me
All feelings
You terminate for me
Disappear like man was never here
Long live machine
Our future supreme
Your man overthrown
Spit out the bone, yeah
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place?
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reasons tend to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah
Like silver scrapes in May
Now the sands become a crust
And most of you have gone away...
Yea, gone away
Ah, come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you'll want to know where winds come from
Well, it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the four winds bar, mm, yeah
Yeah
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Four winds at the four winds bar
Two doors locked, ten windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hey!
Hey! Yeah!
Hey! Yeah!
Hey!
Ooh, in hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Never warms, never warms
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place?
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at four winds bar
It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Call me Desdenova, eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent
Astronomy - a star
Astronomy - a star
Astronomy (astronomy) - a star, yeah
Astronomy - a star
Astronomy
Do unto others
As they've done to you
But what the hell is
This world coming to?
Blow the universe
Into nothingness
Nuclear warfare
Shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse
Short and burning fast
Armageddon's here
Like said in the past
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
-Solo-
Soon to fill our lungs
The hot winds of death
The Gods are laughing
So take your last breath
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight
When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this i cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home
A-haha!
Oh yeah
Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy and dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't
Take it
Any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is
Going to
Take your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't
Take it
Any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is
Going to
Take your breath away
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't
Take it
Any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is
Going to
Take your breath away
Die die die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die die die my darling
Just shut your pretty eyes
I'll be seeing you again

So don't cry to me oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box
Don't cry to me oh baby

Don't cry to me oh baby
Had to know it was in your power

Dead end goal for a dead end girl

Dead-end goal for a dead-end girl

Now your life drains on that floor
Don't cry to me oh baby
Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Shut your pretty mouth

I'll be seeing you in hell
Die, die, die
Die, die, die
Die, die, die
Die...
Watch your back, so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life, so you don't see mine
Drape your back, so you won't shine
Watch your back, so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life, so you don't see mine
Drape your back, so you won't shine
Ooh, then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
Ooh, then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
Using what I want
To get what you want
Using what I want
To get what you want
Using what I want
To get what you want
Using what I want
To get what you want
Ooh, sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over 'til I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away but I'm back again
Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over 'til I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away but I'm back again
Ooh, then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
And she squeezes tighter
I still lie to get a smile
Using what I want
To get what you want
Using what I want
To get what you want
Using what I want
To get what you want
Using what I want
To get what you want
Ooh, sweet Amber
How sweet are you?

She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in

She traces me and draws me in
Ooh, sweet Amber
(Ooh, sweet Amber)
Ooh, sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?
How sweet are you?

It's never as sweet as it seems
The sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message received, we're moving back
Preparations are made for the journey back
It's a survival, supplies are packed
No more nights in this eternal hell
Destination is simple, we move out
Killing time!
Move up to the line
Killing time!
Your turn to kill
Killing time!
What do you say?
Killing time!
I'm killing time!
And he knew what was needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, it's kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he'll take your life
The silence is over, the attack's began
Killing and hatred drive you insane
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message received, we're moving back
Killing time!
Move up to the line
Killing time!
Your turn to kill
Killing time!
What do you say?
Killing time!
I'm killing time!
The sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message received, we're moving back
And he knew what was needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, it's kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he'll take your life
Killing time!
Move up to the line
Killing time!
Your turn to kill
Killing time!
What do you say?
Killing time!
I'm killing time!
Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in day out live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Dear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly
Dear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still what's left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
Dear Mother
Dear Father
You've clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say not as I do
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly
I'm in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Dear Mother
Dear Father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething
I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew
Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
and you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Lie
Lie
Lie
Lie
Lie
Lie
Lie
Lie
I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
(Scream!) from my soul
(Fate!) mystified
(Hell!) forever more
(Scream!) from my soul
(Fate!) mystified
(Hell!) forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face
That learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite
Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like Conviction
A Premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny
I deny
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye
Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison
That I swallow
But I want the world to die
Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a General
Without a mission
Until the war will start again... start again.
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye
Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven that turns that key
That brings you straight down to your knees
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees
Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
That was just your life
My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain
I fall 'cause I let go
The net below has rot away
So, my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins
The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So, wicked and worn
So, as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due
Please forgive me
My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for faith
Touch clean with a dirty hand
I touched the clean to the waste
The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So, wicked and worn
So, as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
So, low the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So, you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again
And I cry to the alleyway
Confess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken to match my face
The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So, wicked and worn
So, as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
So, low the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So, you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again
My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
Iced Honey Lyrics
You can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey
Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey
If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb
If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start
And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticks
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey
Girl, you really got me goin'
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
See, don't ever set me free
I always wanna be by your side
Girl, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
Oh no...
(Solo)
See, don't ever set me free
I always wanna be by your side
Girl, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
